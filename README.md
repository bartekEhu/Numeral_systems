## General info

The application presents a simple calculator which allows to convert the entered number into other number systems.
The implemented systems:
- decimal
- binary
- octal
- hexadecimal

The program does not use ready-made functions to change values to other systems, but they were written by me (to_dec.py, from_dec.py), in order to practice programming.
The application is capable of detecting where data has been entered and then converting it to other systems, additionally the program detects wrongly entered data, and in the case of the hexadecimal system accepts the entry of small and large characters (A-F).

## Future

I plan to add things such as:
- expand the interface
- optimise code
- add comments to the interface.py
